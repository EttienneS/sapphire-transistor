# sapphire-transistor

Card game made in Unity3D.  Use cards to build the world and populate it with buildings.

Project was made a test for the starting_block project.  Found that project was heavily over-engineered in some ways and lacking in other.

Both projects are currently on ice as they are beyond the scope of a single person.

## NOT CURRENTLY IN ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.
